            style="width:33%">
            <p>Programming is key to working with A.I. because that is how it is made. It 
                can be very complicated to work with and prepare for doing actual tasks. 
                This is the most time consuming part of building A.I. especially if something 
                is wrong with the program, because then we have to figure out what is wrong and 
                then fix it.</p>

            <img alt="Circuit" class='card-img' src='styles/images/circuit.jpg'
            style="width:33%">
            <p>Another big part of working with A.I. is the having the speed and space to actually 
                run such a powerful tool. This comes in the form of the hardware that the A.I. is 
                being run off of. The better our equipment, the faster that the A.I. can run. It 
                can be expensive to get some of the computer parts that will run an A.I. at a decent 
                speed, especially when the task you want it to do is complicated.</p>

            style="width:33%">
            <p>Some A.I. are perfectly fine running and doing their thing without affecting the real 
                world, however, we don't see A.I. being completely digital forever. We see A.I. powered 
                robots cleaning the streets, doing dangerous jobs, and even helping with search and 
                rescue operations! For tasks like these, we need to have something the A.I. can affect, 
                AKA, robots. We are testing to see how these robots and A.I. can work together to be 
                able to do things that they would never be able to do alone.</p>

            <h2>The What and the Why</h2>
            <p>What are we doing and why are we doing it? Those are two big questions. To kill two 
                birds with one stone; we are changing the future! Now, I know that is vague, so let 
                me go into more detail. We want to make this world a better place and we believe that 
                one of the best ways that we can do that is to develop new technology that can help 
                us to make that change. Imagine an artificial intelligence that can run a ctiy's power 
                grid and so much more!</p>
