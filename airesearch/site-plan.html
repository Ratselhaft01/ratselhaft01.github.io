      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Artificial intelligence is one of the biggest new technologies today, but it still needs a lot of work to be fully realized. 
          What is one of the biggest problems in developing new technology? Funding. Having the funds to continue doing your work and 
          to have good equipment. As someone who has worked with A.I. and as someone who can build a good looking, informative site, I 
          can put together a website that will get funding for your research. This website will draw in people and show off your work. 
          This will allow potential investors to find you, instead of the other way around.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience is investors. Now, we aren't just looking for million dollar grants, but we are also looking for smaller 
          funders, such as people that are willing to donate just 1 dollar a month. (Think of patreon) The idea is that we get excitement 
          from all sorts of people and the funding

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This page is the big hooker! The idea is to grab the attention of people and get them interested in the site and the research.
        If we can tell people about how important the research that is being conducted is, then they are much more likely to want to help 
        by donating some money. Everyone loves to help out with a cause, especially if they think it will benefit them later!

      <h3>The Research</h3>
      <p>
        This page is for those who are more curious about the actual research being conducted. This page will show the projects that have been 
        done and the goal for future projects. The idea is to show more of the meat of what can and will be done with AI. This allows people to 
        see the affects of AI and more of the physical outcome.

      <h3>Funding</h3>
      <p>
        This page is for the actual funding part, as the name suggests. It is also more about convincing people towards funding, since they are 
        definitely open to it if they clicked onto this page. This page will go into more of the details and desires of the team to try and create 
        a connection between the team and the people looking at the page. It will also explain how every dollar counts and how this will help in the development of AI.
